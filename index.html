        <h4>The eye</h4>
        <p>
             The eye is a highly complex structure that works to focus light that enters it, convert it into a neural signal and send this signal to the brain for interpretation. The eyes consist of many internal structures, which help it accomplish such an essential function. One of these structures is the retina, which is a specialized, light sensitive lining of neural tissue at the back of the eye that is responsible for converting light into signals that can be interpreted by the brain (Runkle, 2015). Due to its sensitivity, the retina is supported by the blood retinal barrier, a highly vascular structure, which nourishes the retina. The blood retinal barrier is made up of retinal photoreceptors and contains vascular and epithelial layers, both which work to maintain the proper conditions for the retina to function.

        <h4>Diabetic Retinopathy</h4>
        <p>
            Diabetic retinopathy is a condition that develops due to metabolic changes in vascular endothelial retinal cells in response to the high glucose levels (hyperglycemia) present in diabetics. It causes damage to the retina, which when impaired can cause severe changes in vision, and often results in blindness. Thus, in those with diabetes, diabetic retinopathy remains the leading cause of blindness (Hammes, 2013). The hyperglycemic conditions present in those with diabetes is known to be the cause of the development of the condition, but the mechanisms by which this excess glucose affects the retina are not very well understood. What is known currently is that the hyperglycemia lowers the permeability of the blood retinal barrier which leads to leakage of fluids from blood vessels causing the conditions of the retina to be disturbed. Due to the high sensitivity of the retina, this often leads to complete loss of vision (Shin, 2014).

         <h4>Recent Research</h4>
        <p>
           A recent study done has shown that micro-RNAs could possibly play a role in this pathway (McArther, 2011). Micro-RNAs are small non-coding RNAs that are part of a complex regulatory network and perform many functions. One such function is working with transcription factors. Transcription factors regulate gene activity in DNA, and perform actions such as slicing genes. MicroRNAs work toward the same goal, inhibiting the translation of messenger RNA into proteins. They are also involved in a variety of other cell processes like differentiation, apoptosis, and proliferation (Chuang and Jones, 2007). Specifically, the researchers explored the role Micro-RNA 200b plays in diabetic retinopathy. They found that this micro RNA is connected to VEGF, or vascular endothelial growth factor, which is a signaling protein that promotes the growth of new blood vessels. They found that the hyperglycemia led to a decrease in miR-200b and an increase in VEGF. After mimic mirR-200b transfection, they found that VEGF decreased and this led to decreased permeability in the blood retinal barrier. The study mentioned p300 as another possible influence on this condition, but did not explore this relationship in depth. Other papers have also brought up the possible involvement of other factors such as p53 and SHP-1, which have been shown to be upregulated in those with diabetes.

        <h3>My Project</h3>
        <p>
            Based on current knowledge, the researcher is investigating the effect of up-regulation of microRNA 200-b on the development of diabetic retinopathy, as well as the levels of other cellular factors (such as VEGF) to determine if any one of them could be used as predict the development and prevent and slow down the progression of diabetic retinopathy. The researcher will measure the levels of these cellular factor by use of various ELISAs. The researcher's hypothesis is that the up-regulation of microRNA 200-b will decrease VEGF levels and reverse the levels of other factors, thus increasing cell viability and maintaining cell homeostasis. Also, the researcher will be measuring cellular stress and viability as a measure of how this affects the cell as a whole and ultimately the progression of the condition. The implications of finding such a pathway are huge. Inhibitors of any molecule involved in the pathway can be used to halt the progression of the condition-and ultimately save someone’s vision.

        <h4>Future Plans</h4>
        <p>
           I am planning to investigate the role of the nf-kb pathway in this process. nf-kb is a transcription factor, which, when increased, increases production of inflammatory cytokine proteins. Examples of these cytokine proteins include ICAM1,iNOS, and COX2 mRNA. In addition, superoxide is shown to posisbly play a role in this increase of production. These cytokine proteins affect the permeability of the endothelial cells, which is how they are able to regulate its permeability.
