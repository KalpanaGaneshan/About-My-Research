        <h1>Trypsinization</h1>
        <h3>What you need</h3>
            <p>
                1. Media<br>
                2. Trypsin<br>
                3. Flasks<br>
                4. Hood<br>
                5. Pipettes and Pipettor<br>
            </p>
        <h3>Prep</h3>
            <p>
                Spray gloves and workspace<br>
                Place media and trypsin in hot water bath to thaw<br>
            </p>
        <h3>Procedure</h3>
            <p>
                1. Place all materials under hood<br>
                2. Open cap of flask<br>
                3. Open 10 mL pipette and screw into pipetter<br>
                4. Take out all media out of flask and put in discard beaker<br>
                5. Open trypsin bottle<br>
                6. Take out 5 mL pipette (same as above)<br>
                7. Pipette 3 mL of trypsin in flask if you are working with a T-75 Flask and 1.5 mL of trypsin if you are working with a T-25 Flask<br>
                8. Tap flask to spread trypsin<br>
                9. Pipette out trypsin into waste beaker<br>
                10.  Pipette same amount of trypsin (as before) and put in flask<br>
                11. Place the flask in the incubator for three minutes<br>
                12. View cells under microscope to make sure that cells are moving and not attached. <br>
                13. Pipette out trypsin into waste beaker<br>
                14. Add 10-12 mL media into flask and place in incubator</p>
